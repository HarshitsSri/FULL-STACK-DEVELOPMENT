Day 2
    -learned about css display property -block,inline,block-inline,none
    -in block property the container takes the full width of the page
    -in inline property the container takes only that amount of space which
     which is required to fill its element
    -Negative side of inline is that we cant modify the width
    -so block-inline is used which has property of inline with additional
     additional feature of width adjustment
    -none is used to hide the container,it is different from visibility:hidden as it just reduces the
     opacity of the container to zero but the container takes its space in the browser

                        it just positions it on top of other element if they come in it's
                        path

                        diff between relative and absolute is that relative positioning is done respective to the positioning of the element default
                        where as absolute positioning is done with relative to parent
